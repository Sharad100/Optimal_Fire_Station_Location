# Optimal_Fire_Station_Location

The rising trend in wildfire occurrence and severity has put a strain on wildfire management organizations by spreading out limited resources to meet increasing demand. There has been extensive prior research and data collection to determine the areas of highest risk and to predict regional wildfire damages based on historical trends. Our group aims to utilize this data to calculate optimal fire station locations by utilizing a single-objective facility location problem algorithm incentivized for cost reduction. Further work would be needed to refine the algorithm to accommodate for more realistic factors including access to water and roadways as well as better accounting for the costs involved, but our work serves as a proof of concept and lays the foundation for future research. Implementation of this algorithm would allow public fire planning agencies (such as CAL FIRE and Forest Service) to shift resources to where they would be most effective.

We take into account a combination of forest density and fire hazard severity to come up with a demand for each fire. The capacity per station, cost per station, and the amount of area being analyzed is set at the beginning of the code and can be fine-tuned for sensitivity analysis.
